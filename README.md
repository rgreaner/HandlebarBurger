# HandlebarBurger

This is a burger logger created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM.

The burgers initialized in the database all default to a false status of devoured.  


HandlebarBurger is an app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.


Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
